# Ball_Interception
Python3 script intended to Identify a brightly colored ball, predict its trajectory, and intercept it

This code uses a veriety of open source modules with Python3 to complete its task of identifing a brightly colored ball, predicting its trajectory, and intercepting it.

To use this code you must have installed the most recent versions of numpy, imutils, opencv-python, matplotlib, and scipy. 
Included are pipenv files intended to simplify and standardize the modules used within the code, you will need the latest version of pipenv in order to run and use these additional files.

In its current stage, the program is able to identify brighly colored objects (as defined by the color bounds defined within the code) plot and record the points, return a quadratic regression for the path of the ball, display the regression as the ball is in flight, and reset itself for multiple balls.

This project is still in development.
